Dogewallet- The New and Improved Version- Made for the Shibes by the Shibes
----------------------------------
The remastering of the Original Doughwallet Wallet for IOS

**Dogecoin done right**

The simplest and most secure dogecoin wallet on any platform ever

**Features:**

- the Best and Only  dogecoin client for iOS 
- doesn't rely on any server or web service 
- single backup phrase that works forever 
- private keys never leave your device 
- "simplified payment verification" for fast mobile performance 
- import password protected paper wallets 
- "payment protocol" payee identity certification
- open source

**Security:**

Dough Remade represents a major step forward in dogecoin wallet security. It is
designed to be secure against malware, security issues with other apps, and
even physical theft. It makes full use of the security features provided by iOS,
including AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing and data protection, code
signing, and keychain services.

**Reliability:**

Unlike other iOS dogecoin wallets, Dough Remade is a real dogecoin client. There
are no external web services or servers to get hacked or go down, so you always
have access to your money. It uses "simplified payment verification" or
[SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients) mode
to retrive data directly from the dogecoin network with the fast performance you
need in a mobile environment.

**Convenience:**

Your entire wallet is backed up with a single convenient backup phrase that
will work forever. If your device is ever lost or broken, use your backup
phrase to restore your balance and transaction history on another device. This
is possible because doughwallet is a 
[BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)
"deterministic" wallet, meaning that all your dogecoin addresses and private
keys are generated from a single "seed".

Dough Remade is open source and available under the terms of the MIT license.

**WARNING:** installation on jailbroken devices is strongly discouraged

Any jailbreak app can grant itself access to every other app's keychain data
and rob you by self-signing as described [here](http://www.saurik.com/id/8)
and including `<key>application-identifier</key><string>*</string>` in its
.entitlements file.
